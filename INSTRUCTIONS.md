## ðŸš€ Project Summary
This project implements and evaluates **Fast-SCNN**, a real-time semantic segmentation network, using the [Cityscapes dataset](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/). We retrained the model for 50 epochs, compared it to the original 160-epoch model, and tested both models on real-world images including Rose-Hulman campus scenes.
